        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is an open-source programming language that is free to use and distribute. Many developers worldwide utilized it to create GUI applications and web applications with fewer, easily readable codes. Building large and complicated software applications is much faster with lesser time.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "   - A python interpreter is a computer program that converts each high-level program statement into machine code. An interpreter translates the command that you write out into code that the computer can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "   - A keyword refers to a predefined word that python reserves for working programs that have a specific meaning, You can't use a keyword anywhere else. Python Identifiers are the different values that a programmer can use to define various variables, integers, functions, and classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - Keywords define the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful to the human readers of the program to remember what the variable is used for.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, \"mutability\" refers to the ability of an object to be changed or modified after it has been created; a mutable object can have its contents altered directly, while an immutable object cannot be changed once initialized.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   - Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - The == operator compares the value or equality of two objects, whereas the Python is operator checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions together and evaluate them as a single boolean expression. There are three types of logical operators in Python: `and`, `or`, and `not`. The `and` operator returns `True` if both conditions it is evaluating are true, otherwise it returns `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, \"type casting\" refers to the process of manually converting a variable's data type from one type to another, using built-in functions like int(), float(), or str() to explicitly change the data type as needed in your code; essentially, it allows you to transform a value from one data type (like a string) into another data type (like an integer) when necessary for operations or calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    - In programming, \"implicit type casting\" means a data type conversion done automatically by the compiler without any explicit instruction from the programmer, usually when converting a smaller data type to a larger one, while \"explicit type casting\" requires the programmer to manually specify the conversion using a casting operator, typically when there might be potential data loss by converting to a smaller data type; essentially, implicit casting happens automatically, while explicit casting is done intentionally by the developer.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, conditional statements like \"if\", \"elif\", and \"else\" are used to control the flow of a program by allowing different blocks of code to be executed based on whether certain conditions are true or false, essentially enabling the program to make decisions and take different actions depending on the situation; this makes your code more dynamic and efficient by only executing specific parts when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "    - In Python, elif is short for \"else if\" and is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    - A \"for\" loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat a block of code, while a \"while\" loop is used when you want to repeat code as long as a certain condition remains true, meaning you might not know how many times the loop will run beforehand; essentially, \"for\" loops are best for iterating through a known set of items, while \"while\" loops are better for repeating actions until a specific condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "    - in general a while loop is used if you want an action to repeat itself until a certain condition is met i.e. if statement. An for loop is used when you want to iterate through an object. i.e. iterate through an array.\n",
